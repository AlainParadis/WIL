2. **Prepare Your Work**: Gather 3-5 of your best design projects from school assignments or personal work.
3. **Craft Your Email**: Write a professional email to request a meeting.
4. **Prepare for the Meeting**: If a designer agrees to meet, prepare questions about portfolio building, industry trends, and career advice.
