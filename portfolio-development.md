title: Portfolio Development
---
This unofficial summer assignment is designed to help you kickstart your professional network to gain valuable insights for building your portfolio. By reaching out to professional designers and [recent grads](index.html#grads), you'll receive expert advice on your current work and guidance for your future career in graphic design.

### The Objective

Connect with professional designers to receive feedback on your current projects and advice on building a strong portfolio.

### The Process

1. **Identify Designers**: Research and create a list of professional designers you admire or whose work aligns with your interests.
2. **Prepare Your Work**: Gather 3-5 of your best design projects from school assignments or personal work.
3. **Craft Your Email**: Write a professional email to request a meeting.
4. **Prepare for the Meeting**: If a designer agrees to meet, prepare questions about portfolio building, industry trends, and career advice.
5. **Follow Up**: Send a thank-you email expressing your appreciation for their time and insights.
6. If or when you make the suggested improvement to your portfolio pieces, you could always share with them.

The file linked below is a starting point for your message to a pro you wish to meet. You should personalize it to make it sound more like you.

You should also connect with each designer on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/). When you do so, *always* include a message in the note area in the invitation. Once you're connected, it will give you an opportunity to stay in touch. Feel free to comment on their posts to keep the connection alive.

Seek out local events to attend to network with practicing designers. There's [Creative Mornings](https://creativemornings.com/cities/ott), [Ottawa Design Club](https://www.ottdesign.club), and [others](https://www.eventbrite.ca).

### The Benefits

By doing this, you will,

- Gain professional feedback on your work
- Learn about industry expectations for portfolios
- Build your professional network
- Prepare for fieldwork opportunities in level 6


Remember, this is a self-directed assignment for your professional development. It's not graded, but the benefits to your career can be significant. I will be available throughout the summer if you need advice or support. By taking on this initiative, you're demonstrating professionalism and dedication to your craft â€” qualities that will serve you well in your design career.

I'd really love to hear about your experiences. Please don't hesitate to share them with me!
