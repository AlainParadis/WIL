### The Event

The Grad Show is usually held the last week of Fieldwork. That'll be {{ site.data.course-info.grad-show-date }}.

### Grad Show Work Spreadsheet

Your first task is to choose a team to which you wish to contribute for Grad Show organization and fundraising.

<a href="{{ site.data.course-info.work-spreadsheet }}" title="Open the spreadsheet." target="_blank" class="medium">Grad Show Teams/Work Log</a>

As you accomplish concrete tasks to organize the Grad Show and do fundraising, you'll document it in this spreadsheet.

### Fundraising

The Grad Show is a self-funded event organized by students in the framework of this course. All students are expected to participate in fundraising activities. In recent years, fundraising has included mobile bake sales, a GoFundMe page, pub nights, and art sales.

The Student Association also contributes about $20 per graduating student. It's up to you to enquire what funds are available from the S.A.

### Expenses

The rental fee for the Horticulture Building is about $3000 for the evening. There are other event costs. We generally want to fundraise over $4000. It's a good idea to leave some money behind for potential future program project funding.

### Team Workings & Functions

You all need to be part of one of the teams listed on the <a href="{{ site.data.course-info.work-spreadsheet }}" title="Grad Show Teams/Work Log" target="_blank">Work Log</a>. Being on a team doesn't limit you. You can participate in any of the activities. Teams are expected to collaborate. For instance, if the Motion Team needs brand graphics, they'll request them with specifications from the Branding Team.

Two people are elected as chairs to oversee all activities as well as coordinate and attend meetings with team leads. They meet with {{ site.data.course-info.prof-screen-name }} to provide progress updates. They act as overseers of, and liaisons between all the teams leads. Team leads are the voice for their teams.

#### Branding Team

The branding team adopts the identity that was chosen by the cohort. They collaborate with the designer of the brand to create branding guidelines. The branding team mostly prepares on-brand graphics required by other teams. All creative decisions are shared with the cohort.

#### Web Team

This team works with the Web Design instructor to build the grad web site. They request assets from the Branding Team. All creative decisions are shared with the cohort.

#### Social Media Team

The social team promotes each student on all social channels with graphics that are coordinated with the Branding Team. Fundraising events are also posted to socials.

#### Motion Team

Produce and manage on-brand motion graphics for the web site, for event promotions, and for motion pieces that play at the Grad Show.

#### Photography Team

The photography team helps to coordinate the photography of students for the website. They document events including bake sales, pub nights and more.
