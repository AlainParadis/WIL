### Grad Show Work Spreadsheet

Your first task is to choose a team to which you wish to contribute for Grad Show organization and fundraising.

<div class="alertBox">
<h3>Face-2-Face</h3>
<p>
For 2023, fieldwork will be in person, with a minimum 50% hybrid.
</p>

</div>

<a href="{{ site.data.course-info.work-spreadsheet }}" title="Open the spreadsheet." target="_blank" class="medium">Grad Show Teams/Work Log</a>

As you accomplish concrete tasks to organize the Grad Show and do fundraising, you'll document it in this spreadsheet.
